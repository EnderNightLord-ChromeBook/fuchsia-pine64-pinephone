# Describes the target device environment in which a test should run. This
# specification is written in JSON to the build directory, to be aggregated
# at test-time.
#
# Parameters
#
#   name (required)
#     [string] The test's target name.
#
#   location (required)
#     [string]: Unique reference to a test, e.g., a filesystem path or a
#     fuchsia URI.
#
#   command (optional)
#     [list of strings]: Command to invoke to run the test. If unset, location
#     will be invoked upon execution.
#
#   deps (optional)
#     [list of labels]: List of labels that the test depends on.
#
#   environments (optional, default: QEMU for fuchsia; else a VM)
#     [list of scopes] Device environments in which the test should run.
#
#     Each scope in $environments contains:
#
#       dimensions (required)
#         [scope] Dimensions of bots to target. Valid dimensions are
#         element-wise subsets of the test platform entries defined in
#         //build/testing/platforms.gni.
#
#       tags (optional)
#         [list of strings] keys on which tests may be grouped. Tests with
#         given tags will be run (1) together, and (2) only with support from
#         the Infrastructure team. Labels are used as an escape hatch from the
#         default testing pipeline for special tests or environments.
