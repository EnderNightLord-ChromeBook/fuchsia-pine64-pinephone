# Third-party Rust Crates

## Overview

OSRB approval is required for third-party crates. To get approval, you will
need to follow the instructions under the "Process for 3rd Party Hosted
Code" section in [this document][osrb-process].

Third-party crates depended on by `rustc_binary` and `rustc_library` targets
are stored in [`//third-party/rust_crates/vendor`][3p-vendor].
This set of crates is based on the dependencies listed in
[`//third_party/rust_crates/Cargo.toml`][3p-cargo-toml],
and is updated by running `fx update-rustc-third-party`, which will update
the precise versions of the crates used in the `Cargo.lock` file and download
any necessary crates into the `vendor` dir.

## Adding a new vendored dependency

If a crate is not available in the vendor directory, it can to be added with
the following steps:

1. Reference the crates you need in [`third_party/rust_crates/Cargo.toml`][3p-cargo-toml].
1. Run `scripts/fx update-rustc-third-party`. This will download all crates listed in
   [`rust_crates/Cargo.toml`][3p-cargo-toml] as well as their dependencies and
   place them in the `vendor` directory. If on Linux, note that the `pkg-config`
   package must be installed for this to work.
1. Do a build that includes the Rust third-party build. `fx set core.x64 && fx build`
   or similar is more than enough.
1. Run `fx update-rustc-crate-map --output third_party/rust_crates/crate_map.json`.
   This will update `crate_map.json` with information about the Rust crates available
   for each target (Fuchsia and host).
1. `git add` the `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `crate_map.json` and the `vendor` directory.
1.  __Do not__  upload this change to gerrit yet.
1. Get OSRB approval. Make sure to include the requested information for all
   new crates pulled in by your new dependency.
   If there are any files in the source repository that are not included when
   vendored, make a note of that for the OSRB reviewer. For example, font files
   that are only used for testing but are excluded when the crate is vendored.
   If you are not a Google employee, you will need to ask a Google employee to
   do this part for you.
1. After getting the OSRB approval, upload the change to Gerrit.
Get code-review+2, merge the change into [third_party/rust_crates][3p-crates].

## Adding a new mirror

1. Request the addition of a mirror on *fuchsia.googlesource.com*;
1. Add the mirror to the [Jiri manifest][jiri-manifest] for the Rust runtime;
1. Add a patch section for the crate to the workspace;
1. Run the update script.

## Unicode crates

If the project requires importing a new third-party crate to handle
functionality related to Unicode and internationalization, prefer crates from
the [UNIC project](https://crates.io/crates/unic) when available.

### Grandfathered non-UNIC crates

The following non-UNIC crates are already vendored and are grandfathered, but we
will aim to migrate to UNIC equivalents when possible.

* unicode-bidi
* unicode-normalization
* unicode-segmentation
* unicode-width
* unicode-xid

We should encourage upstream dependencies to migrate to UNIC as well.

### Rationale for standardization

UNIC crates have distinct advantages over other crates:

* UNIC crates are developed in a single repo, with shared common code and a
  single version scheme.

  * Independently developed crates do not share a common release schedule,
    versioning scheme, or adherence to any particular version of the Unicode
    standard.

* UNIC crates are generated from a consistent set of Unicode data files.

  * Each of the independent crates uses an arbitrary version and subset of
    the data. For example, different crates might have different assumptions
    about whether a particular code point is assigned, what its properties
    are, etc.

* The UNIC project is aiming for comprehensive feature coverage, to be like
  [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/) for Rust. If the project succeeds, our
  dependencies on unrelated Unicode crates should be reduced over time.
