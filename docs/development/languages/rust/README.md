# Rust

[TOC]

## Build

There are two GN target templates which should be used for Rust projects:

- [`rustc_library`][target-library-rustc] defines a library which can be used by
  other targets.
- [`rustc_binary`][target-binary-rustc] defines an executable.

The [garnet/examples/rust][rust-examples] directory has some examples of Rust
packages that use these targets, as do the [Rust FIDL examples][fidl-tutorial].

### Building with a custom toolchain

If you want to test out Fuchsia with your own custom-built versions of rustc or
cargo, you can set the `rustc_prefix` argument to `fx set`, like this:

```
fx set core.x64 --release --args "rustc_prefix=\"/path/to/bin/dir\""
```

## Cargo.toml

Fuchsia Rust targets are not built with Cargo during a normal build, and as
such, do not require `Cargo.toml` files. However, having a `Cargo.toml` file for
your target is useful for integration with IDEs such as Intellij and VSCode, and
for using the [`fargo`][fargo] tool to build and test targets without going
through a full GN build and run cycle each time.

A `Cargo.toml` file can be automatically generated for `rustc_library` and
`rustc_binary` targets based on their .gn file definitions by running:

```sh
fx gen-cargo path/from/fuchsia/root/to/target:label
```

Or, if you're already in a directory with a single Rust target, `fx gen-cargo`
alone should work too.

You must build the target via a regular Fuchsia build before running this
command.

## Autogenerated docs

You can generate and browse HTML documentation for your target and its
dependencies by running:

```sh
fx rustdoc path/from/fuchsia/root/to/target:label --open
```

## Tests

You can run unit tests on connected devices using `fx`, with the `fx run-test
{package name}` command, assuming your package in `BUILD.gn` has
`with_unit_tests = true`.

*** note
Note that in order to use `fx run-test`, you can't override
`package_name="..."` in your `package`  or `test_package` declaration. This
issue is tracked by BLD-338.

## Style

We don't currently have a style guide for Rust, but you should run `fx rustfmt`
or `fx format-code` before submitting. We mostly use the rustfmt defaults, but
have a couple [custom settings][rustfmt-toml].
