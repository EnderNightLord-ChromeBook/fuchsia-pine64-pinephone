  // |GestureDetector|). Subclasses override methods (and the destructor) to
  // handle events. The default implementation does nothing.
  //
  // Broadly, this handles two classes of gestures: taps and (multi)drags. Taps
  // are defined as the addition of touch points and their subsequent removal
  // without appreciable movement from any of the pointers. Multidrags cover
  // all other cases.
  // TODO(MI4-2403): This may need redefinition if time-based taps are
  // supported at this level.

  // In the interest of reducing input latency, a multi-pointer tap is
  // considered "committed" as soon as any pointer is released. However, it can
  // subsequently evolve into a multidrag if any remaining pointer is moved
  // past the drag threshold or any new pointers are added.
  //
  // The |Interaction| is destroyed once the interaction ends, when all
  // pointers are removed.
