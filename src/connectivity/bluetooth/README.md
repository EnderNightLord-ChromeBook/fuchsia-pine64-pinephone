Bluetooth
=========

The Fuchsia Bluetooth system aims to provide a dual-mode implementation of the
Bluetooth Host Subsystem (5.0+) supporting a framework for developing Low Energy
and Traditional profiles.

## Getting Started

### API Examples

Examples using Fuchsia's Bluetooth Low Energy APIs can be found
[here](examples).

### Control API

Dual-mode (LE + Classic) GAP operations that are typically exposed to privileged
clients are performed using the [control.fidl](/sdk/fidl/fuchsia.bluetooth.control/control.fidl)
API. This API is intended for managing local adapters, device discovery & discoverability,
pairing/bonding, and other settings.

[`bt-cli`](tools/bt-cli) is a command-line front-end
for this API:

  ```
  $ bt-cli
  bluetooth> list-adapters
    Adapter 0
      id: bf004a8b-d691-4298-8c79-130b83e047a1
      address: 00:1A:7D:DA:0A
  bluetooth>
  ```

We also have a Flutter [module](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/docs/glossary.md#module)
that acts as a Bluetooth system menu based on this API at
[topaz/bin/bluetooth\_settings](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/master/bin/bluetooth_settings/).

### Tools

See the [bluetooth/tools](tools/) package for more information on
available command line tools for testing/debugging.

### Running Tests

Your build configuration may or may not include Bluetooth tests. Ensure
Bluetooth tests are built and installed when paving or OTA'ing with [`fx set`](docs/development/workflows/fx.md#configure-a-build):

  ```
  $ fx set workstation.x64 --with-base="//bundles:tools,//src/connectivity/bluetooth"
  ```

#### Tests

Bluetooth test packages are listed in
[tests/bluetooth](/garnet/packages/tests/bluetooth) and each contains at least one
test binary. Refer to package definitions for each package's binaries.

Each test binary is a [component](/docs/glossary.md#component)
whose runtime environment is defined by its [`.cmx` component manifest](/docs/the-book/package_metadata.md#Component-Manifest)

For example, `bt-host-unittests` is a [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
binary that contains all the C++ bt-host subsystem unit tests and is a part of
the [`bluetooth-tests`](tests/BUILD.gn) package.

##### Running on a Fuchsia device

* Run all the bt-host unit tests from the target shell:

  ```
  $ run-test-component bt-host-unittests
  ```

* Or use the `--gtest_filter`
[flag](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/advanced.md#running-a-subset-of-the-tests) to run a subset of the tests:

  ```
  # This only runs the L2CAP unit tests.
  $ run-test-component bt-host-unittests --gtest_filter=L2CAP_\*
  ```

* And use the `--verbose` flag to set log verbosity:

  ```
  # This logs all messages logged using FXL_VLOG up to level 2 (equivalent to ::bt::common::LogSeverity:SPEW)
  $ run-test-component bt-host-unittests --verbose=2
  ```

* After making library or test changes, you can push the test package and run it
from your development shell:

  ```
  $ fx run-test bluetooth-tests -t bt-host-unittests -- --gtest_filter=L2CAP_\*
  ```

Note the use of the package name `bluetooth-tests` and the extra `--` used to
separate arguments passed to the test binary.

See [Developing with Fuchsia packages](/docs/development/workflows/package_update.md)
for more details on the package-based workflow.

##### Running on QEMU

If you don't have physical hardware available, you can run the tests in QEMU using the same commands as above. A couple of tips will help run the tests a little more quickly.

* Run the VM with hardware virtualization support: `fx run -k`
* Disable unnecessary logging for the tests:

  ```
  $ run-test-component bt-host-unittests --quiet=10
  ```

With these two tips, the full bt-host-unittests suite runs in ~2 seconds.

#### Integration Tests

See the [Integration Test README](tests/integration/README.md)

### Controlling Log Verbosity

#### Drivers

The most reliable way to enable higher log verbosity is with kernel command line parameters. These can be configured through the `fx set` command:

  ```
  fx set workstation.x64 --args="kernel_cmdline_files=[\"//local/kernel_cmdline.txt\"]"
  ```

Add the commands to `$FUCHSIA_DIR/local/kernel_cmdline.txt`, e.g. to enable full logging for the USB transport, Intel HCI, and host drivers:

  ```
  $ cat $FUCHSIA_DIR/local/kernel_cmdline.txt
  driver.bt_host.log=+trace,+spew,+info,+error,+warn
  driver.bt_hci_intel.log=+trace,+spew,+info,+error,+warn
  driver.bt_transport_usb.log=+trace,+info,+error,+warn
  ```

(HCI drivers other than Intel can also be set. Other hci drivers include `bt_hci_atheros`, `bt_hci_passthrough`, and `bt_hci_emulator`)

Using `fx set` writes these values into the image, so they will survive a restart.

For more detail on driver logging, see [Zircon driver logging](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/master/zircon/docs/ddk/driver-development.md#logging)

#### bin/bt-gap

The Bluetooth system service is invoked by sysmgr to resolve service requests.
The mapping between environment service names and their handlers is defined in
[//garnet/bin/sysmgr/config/services.config](/garnet/bin/sysmgr/config/services.config).
Add the `--verbose` option to the Bluetooth entries to increase verbosity, for
example:

  ```
  ...
    "fuchsia.bluetooth.bredr.Profile":  "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/bt-init#meta/bt-init.cmx",
    "fuchsia.bluetooth.control.Control": "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/bt-init#meta/bt-init.cmx",
    "fuchsia.bluetooth.gatt.Server":  "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/bt-init#meta/bt-init.cmx",
    "fuchsia.bluetooth.le.Central":  "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/bt-init#meta/bt-init.cmx",
    "fuchsia.bluetooth.le.Peripheral":  "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/bt-init#meta/bt-init.cmx",
    "fuchsia.bluetooth.snoop.Snoop":  "fuchsia-pkg://fuchsia.com/bt-snoop#meta/bt-snoop.cmx",
  ...

  ```
