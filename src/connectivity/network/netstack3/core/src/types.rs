// NOTE: The "witness" types UnicastAddr and MulticastAddr - which provide the
// invariant that the value they contain is a unicast or multicast address
// respectively - cannot actually guarantee this property without certain
// promises from the implementations of the UnicastAddress and MulticastAddress
// traits that they rely on. In particular, the values must be "immutable" in
// the sense that, given only immutable references to the values, nothing about
// the values can change such that the "unicast-ness" or "multicast-ness" of the
// values change. Since the UnicastAddress and MulticastAddress traits are not
// unsafe traits, it would be unsound for unsafe code to rely for its soundness
// on this behavior. For a more in-depth discussion of why this isn't possible
// without an explicit opt-in on the part of the trait implementor, see this
// forum thread: https://users.rust-lang.org/t/prevent-interior-mutability/29403
