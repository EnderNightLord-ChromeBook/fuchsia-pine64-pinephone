# End to end (E2E) product test runtime dependencies. This bundle can be added
# to a product build spec that also contains end to end product tests, so they
# can be executed against an instance of the product.

# If the end to end product test is meant to run in an environment without a
# package server - specifically, on a luci bot -, then the end_to_end_deps
# bundle must be added to base_package_labels or cache_package_labels of the
# product, but it cannot be, unlike the end to end tests themselves, in the
# universe_package_labels.
