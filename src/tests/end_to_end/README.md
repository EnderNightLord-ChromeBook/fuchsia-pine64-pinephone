# End to end product tests

End to end product tests for fuchsia products are located here.

Unlike other kinds of tests, end to end product tests are specific to a product,
and therefore must not be included in the global `tests` build target mandated
by the [source tree layout](../../docs/development/source_code/layout.md).
Instead, end to end product tests are included directly in the build
configuration of their products in [//products](../../products/).
