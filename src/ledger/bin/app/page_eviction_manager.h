// that are stored on the device.

// i.e. is not currently opened by an external request, and either of the
// following is true:
// - All contents of the page (commits and objects) are synced to the cloud.
// - The page is offline and empty. A page is offline if it has never been
//   synced to the cloud or a peer. It is empty, if it has a single head commit
//   and the contents of that commit is empty.
//
// If neither of these conditions is fulfilled, the page will fail to be
// evicted.
