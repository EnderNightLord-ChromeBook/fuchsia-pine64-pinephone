// Uploads a batch of commits along with unsynced storage objects and marks
// the uploaded artifacts as synced.
//
// Contract: The class doesn't reason about objects referenced by each commit,
// and instead uploads each unsynced object present in storage at the moment of
// calling Start(). Unsynced objects are marked as synced as they are uploaded.
// The commits in the batch are uploaded in one network request once all objects
// are uploaded.
//
// Usage: call Start() to kick off the upload. |on_done| is called after the
// upload is successfully completed. |on_error| will be called at most once
// after each error. Each time after |on_error| is called the client can
// call Retry() once to retry the upload.
// TODO(ppi): rather than DCHECK on storage errors, take separate callbacks for
// network and disk errors and let PageSync decide on how to handle each.
//
// Lifetime: if BatchUpload is deleted between Start() and |on_done| being
// called, it has to be deleted along with |storage| and |cloud_provider|, which
// otherwise can retain callbacks for pending uploads. This isn't a problem as
// long as the lifetime of page storage and page sync is managed together.
