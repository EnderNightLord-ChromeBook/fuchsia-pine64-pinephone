// Manages cloud sync for a single page.
//
// Contract: commits are uploaded in the same order as storage delivers them.
// The backlog of unsynced commits is uploaded first, then we upload commits
// delivered through storage watcher in the notification order.
//
// Conversely for the remote commits: the backlog of remote commits is
// downloaded first, then a cloud watcher is set to track new remote commits
// appearing in the cloud provider. Remote commits are added to storage in the
// order in which they were added to the cloud provided.
//
// In order to track which remote commits were already fetched, we keep track of
// the server-side timestamp of the last commit we added to storage. As this
// information needs to be persisted through reboots, we store the timestamp
// itself in storage using a dedicated API (Get/SetSyncMetadata()).
//
// Recoverable errors (such as network errors) are automatically retried with
// the given backoff policy, using the given task runner to schedule the tasks.
// TODO(ppi): once the network service can notify us about regained
// connectivity, thread this signal through PageCloudHandler and use it as a
// signal to trigger retries.
//
// Unrecoverable errors (such as internal errors accessing the storage) cause
// the page sync to stop, in which case the client is notified using the error
// callback set via SetOnUnrecoverableError().
