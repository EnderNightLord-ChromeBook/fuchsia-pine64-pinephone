// A simple class that records the identity of the default dispatcher for the thread that it was
// created on, and at later points can tell if the current thread's default dispatcher is the same
// as its creation thread's. This class is thread-safe.
//
// Note that this class is not checking the "current dispatcher", because this information is not
// available in general. It is still useful when the following conditions are met:
// - each dispatcher is bound to at most one thread,
// - every thread (except at most one) has a default dispatcher set,
// - the default dispatcher for a thread does not change after creation.
// Under those assumptions (which hold in Ledger), this class can be used to detect concurrency
// issues in addition to ThreadChecker. It has the benefit of finding issues even in unit tests,
// where all dispatchers are run on the same thread to emulate deterministic multithreading (thus
// making ThreadChecker useless).
