/* Inspection Example App
 *
 * This app demonstrates common features of the Inspect API.
 *
 * The specific application is an employee task manager. Each |Employee| has a
 * number of |Task|s assigned and may have a number of additional |Employee|s
 * reporting to them. The full tree of |Task| and |Employee| are exposed over
 * the Inspect API.
 *
 * We are concerned with obtaining each |Employee|'s individual performance and
 * the performance of their direct reports. In both cases, |EmployeePerformance|
 * is simply the average completion of assigned |Task|s, from 0.0 to 1.0.
