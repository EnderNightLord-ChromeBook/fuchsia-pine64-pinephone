//! # Standardized component inspection
//!
//! This mod contains standardized entry points to the Fuchsia inspect subsystem.  The `inspector()`
//! function can be used to get a top level inspector, which ensures consistent inspect behavior
//! across components.
//!
//! Use the `health()` function to report the component health state through the component inspector.
//!
//! While using the component inspector is not mandatory, it is probably a good idea from the
//! standpoint of uniform reporting.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use fuchsia_inspect::component;
//! let inspector = component::inspector();
//! // Add a standardized health node to the default inspector as early as possible in code.
//! // The component will report `STARTING_UP` as the status from here on.
//! let mut health = component::health();
//!
//! // Add a node with a metric to the inspector.
//! inspector.root().create_string("property", "value");
//!
//! // Report the component health as `OK` when ready.  Calls to `health` are thread-safe.
//! health.set_ok();
//! ```
