// New threads may be created while we're trying to obtain the list.
// |try_count| specifies how many attempts to collect all threads.
// To help minimize the number of iterations required to collect all threads
// |max_num_new_threads| is added to the expected number of threads for each
// iteration. A value of 10 is plenty: How many threads are usually created in
// between two successive calls to zx_object_get_info(ZX_INFO_PROCESS_THREADS)?
// The first call collects the current number of threads and the second call
// collects their koids after space is allocated to hold them.
// The parameter is present in the API to give the client control.
//
// On return, if the result is not ZX_OK then the contents of |*out_threads|
// and |*out_num_available_threads| are unchanged.
// If the result is ZX_OK, then |*out_threads| is filled in with the set of
// threads, and |*out_num_available_threads| is set to the number of
// available threads after the last iteration. Note that it may be more than
// the number of recorded threads, but it will never be less than that.
