# fuchsia.identity.external

fuchsia.identity.external defines the protocols used to interface with
non-Fuchsia forms of identity, such as OAuth and OpenID identity providers.
Most Fuchsia software should use the system token management protocols in
fuchsia.identity.tokens instead of depending on this package.
