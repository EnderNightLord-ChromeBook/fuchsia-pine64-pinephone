/// A moniker encodes the relationship between two component instances that
/// exist in the component instance tree at runtime.
///
/// To understand this better, consider two component instances labeled "A"
/// and "B" that are both children of a component instance labeled "P".
///
/// At runtime, when "B" requests a service from "A" through a channel
/// established by the component manager, the component manager may provide
/// "A" with a moniker that encodes "B's" identity relative to "A" itself.
/// The moniker's encoded value describes the directed path to traverse from
/// "A" (the moniker's origin) to "B" (the moniker's referent), passing
/// through "P" (their common ancestor).
